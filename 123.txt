Hi there! How can I assist you today?

How can I save a YouTube video in my Google drive 
ChatGPT
To save a YouTube video in your Google Drive, follow these steps:

Download the Video:

Use a YouTube video downloader service or app to download the video to your device. Websites like y2mate, SaveFrom, or desktop applications like 4K Video Downloader can help you download videos. Ensure the site or app you use is reputable and follows copyright laws.
Upload to Google Drive:

Go to Google Drive.
Click on the "+ New" button on the left side.
Select "File upload."
Choose the downloaded video file from your device.
Wait for the upload to complete.
Alternatively, some YouTube downloaders offer direct saving to cloud services like Google Drive, simplifying the process. Make sure to check if your chosen downloader has this feature.

 Without download can I upload it directly 
ChatGPT
Yes, you can upload a YouTube video directly to Google Drive without downloading it to your device by using online services that support this feature. Here's a common method using Google Colab:

Open Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab.
Create a New Notebook:

Click on "New Notebook."
Run a Script to Download and Upload:

Copy and paste the following Python code into a code cell in the notebook:
python
Copy code
!pip install pytube
from pytube import YouTube
from google.colab import drive

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Enter the YouTube URL
yt_url = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL'
yt = YouTube(yt_url)
stream = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()

# Download video to local Colab environment
stream.download('/content/')

# Move the video to Google Drive
import shutil
shutil.move(f'/content/{stream.default_filename}', '/content/drive/My Drive/')
print('Upload complete')
Replace YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL with the URL of the YouTube video you want to save.
Run the Code:
Click the "Run" button.
Follow the prompts to allow Google Colab to access your Google Drive.
The script will download the video directly to the Colab environment and then move it to your Google Drive.

This method bypasses downloading the video to your local device, instead using Google Colab as an intermediary to handle the download and upload process.

can i set a fixed resolution of video
ChatGPT
Yes, you can set a fixed resolution for the video when downloading using the pytube library in Google Colab. Here's how you can modify the script to download a specific resolution:

Open Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab.
Create a New Notebook:

Click on "New Notebook."
Run a Script to Download and Upload with a Fixed Resolution:

Copy and paste the following Python code into a code cell in the notebook:
python

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Enter the YouTube URL
yt_url = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL'
yt = YouTube(yt_url)

# Set desired resolution
desired_resolution = '720p'  # Change this to the resolution you want, e.g., '1080p', '480p', etc.

# Filter streams for the desired resolution
stream = yt.streams.filter(res=desired_resolution, file_extension='mp4').first()

if stream:
    # Download video to local Colab environment
    stream.download('/content/')
    print(f'Download complete: {stream.default_filename}')
    
    # Move the video to Google Drive
    import shutil
    shutil.move(f'/content/{stream.default_filename}', '/content/drive/My Drive/')
    print('Upload complete')
else:
    print(f'No stream found with resolution {desired_resolution}')
Replace Placeholder:

Replace YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL with the URL of the YouTube video you want to save.
Set desired_resolution to your preferred resolution, such as '720p', '1080p', '480p', etc.
Run the Code:

Click the "Run" button.
Follow the prompts to allow Google Colab to access your Google Drive.
The script will filter available streams for the desired resolution, download the video in that resolution to the Colab environment, and then move it to your Google Drive. If no stream is found with the specified resolution, the script will inform you.

can i fixed a fps 
ChatGPT
You can filter YouTube video streams based on both resolution and frames per second (fps) using the pytube library. Here's how you can modify the script to specify both the desired resolution and fps:

Open Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab.
Create a New Notebook:

Click on "New Notebook."
Run a Script to Download and Upload with Fixed Resolution and FPS:

Copy and paste the following Python code into a code cell in the notebook:
python

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Enter the YouTube URL
yt_url = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL'
yt = YouTube(yt_url)

# Set desired resolution and fps
desired_resolution = '720p'  # Change this to the resolution you want, e.g., '1080p', '480p', etc.
desired_fps = 30  # Change this to the fps you want, e.g., 30, 60, etc.

# Filter streams for the desired resolution and fps
stream = yt.streams.filter(res=desired_resolution, fps=desired_fps, file_extension='mp4').first()

if stream:
    # Download video to local Colab environment
    stream.download('/content/')
    print(f'Download complete: {stream.default_filename}')
    
    # Move the video to Google Drive
    import shutil
    shutil.move(f'/content/{stream.default_filename}', '/content/drive/My Drive/')
    print('Upload complete')
else:
    print(f'No stream found with resolution {desired_resolution} and {desired_fps} fps')
Replace Placeholder:

Replace YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL with the URL of the YouTube video you want to save.
Set desired_resolution to your preferred resolution, such as '720p', '1080p', '480p', etc.
Set desired_fps to your preferred frames per second, such as 30, 60, etc.
Run the Code:

Click the "Run" button.
Follow the prompts to allow Google Colab to access your Google Drive.
The script will filter available streams for both the specified resolution and fps, download the video in that resolution and fps to the Colab environment, and then move it to your Google Drive. If no stream is found with the specified resolution and fps, the script will inform you.

it show this error
Requirement already satisfied: pytube in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (15.0.0)
Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount("/content/drive", force_remount=True).
No stream found with resolution 1080p
ChatGPT
It looks like there is no stream available with the specified resolution of 1080p. This could be because the video does not have a stream available in 1080p resolution. To troubleshoot and ensure that we get the appropriate stream, we can list all available streams and see what options are available for that particular video.

Here's a modified script to list all available streams first, and then you can choose a resolution and fps that is available:

python
Copy code
!pip install pytube
from pytube import YouTube
from google.colab import drive

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Enter the YouTube URL
yt_url = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL'
yt = YouTube(yt_url)

# List all available streams
streams = yt.streams.filter(file_extension='mp4')
for stream in streams:
    print(f'Res: {stream.resolution}, FPS: {stream.fps}, MIME: {stream.mime_type}')

# Set desired resolution and fps
desired_resolution = '720p'  # Change this to the resolution you want, e.g., '1080p', '480p', etc.
desired_fps = 30  # Change this to the fps you want, e.g., 30, 60, etc.

# Filter streams for the desired resolution and fps
stream = yt.streams.filter(res=desired_resolution, fps=desired_fps, file_extension='mp4').first()

if stream:
    # Download video to local Colab environment
    stream.download('/content/')
    print(f'Download complete: {stream.default_filename}')
    
    # Move the video to Google Drive
    import shutil
    shutil.move(f'/content/{stream.default_filename}', '/content/drive/My Drive/')
    print('Upload complete')
else:
    print(f'No stream found with resolution {desired_resolution} and {desired_fps} fps')
Run the Script to List Available Streams:

Replace YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL with the URL of the YouTube video you want to save.
Run the script to see the list of all available streams for the video.
Choose Available Resolution and FPS:

From the list of available streams, choose a resolution and fps that is available.
Update Desired Resolution and FPS:

Set desired_resolution and desired_fps to the values you found from the list of available streams.
Run the Script Again:

Run the script again with the updated resolution and fps values to download and upload the video to Google Drive.

kaggle not suit me
ChatGPT
If Kaggle doesn't suit your needs, you have other options to run Python scripts in a cloud environment that can accomplish downloading YouTube videos and uploading them to Google Drive. Here's a straightforward approach using a local Python environment:

Using a Local Python Environment
Install Required Libraries:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Install pytube and pydrive libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install pytube pydrive
Python Script:

python
Copy code
from pytube import YouTube
from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive
import os

# Authenticate and create the PyDrive client.
gauth = GoogleAuth()
gauth.LocalWebserverAuth()  # Creates local webserver and auto handles authentication.
drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)

# Enter the YouTube URL
yt_url = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL'
yt = YouTube(yt_url)

# List all available streams
streams = yt.streams.filter(file_extension='mp4')
for stream in streams:
    print(f'Res: {stream.resolution}, FPS: {stream.fps}, MIME: {stream.mime_type}')

# Set desired resolution
desired_resolution = '720p'  # Change this to the resolution you want, e.g., '1080p', '480p', etc.

# Filter streams for the desired resolution
stream = yt.streams.filter(res=desired_resolution, file_extension='mp4').first()

if stream:
    # Download video to current directory
    stream.download()
    print(f'Download complete: {stream.default_filename}')

    # Upload the video to Google Drive
    upload_file = drive.CreateFile({'title': stream.default_filename})
    upload_file.SetContentFile(stream.default_filename)
    upload_file.Upload()
    print(f'Upload complete: {upload_file["title"]}')
    
    # Optionally, delete the downloaded video file from local
    os.remove(stream.default_filename)
else:
    print(f'No stream found with resolution {desired_resolution}')
Instructions:

Install Libraries: Ensure you have pytube and pydrive installed in your local Python environment using pip.

Authentication: When you run the script for the first time, it will open a browser window for you to authenticate with your Google account and grant access to Google Drive.

Set YouTube URL: Replace 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL' with the actual URL of the YouTube video you want to download.

Set Desired Resolution: Update the desired_resolution variable with your preferred resolution (e.g., '720p', '1080p', etc.).

Run the Script: Execute the Python script in your local environment. It will download the YouTube video, upload it to your Google Drive, and optionally delete the downloaded file from your local directory.

This approach allows you to have more control over the environment and execution of the script on your local machine, bypassing the need for a cloud-based service like Kaggle.
